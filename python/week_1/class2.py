# Basic usage of print()
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to python programming")\

# Using print() with variable
name = "Aisha"
age = 25
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Using f-string with print()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")

# Using sting concatenation
first_name = "Ade"
last_name = "Lovelace"
print("Full name: " + first_name+ " " + last_name)

# comma vs concatenation
print("Hello", "word!") # with comma
print("Hello" + " " + "world!") # with concatenation
